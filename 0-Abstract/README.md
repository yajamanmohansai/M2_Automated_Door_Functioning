The automated door functioning to controlling the home automation is based on  pure technology which enhance the quality usage in our daily life.In this projects we define several components which are interconnected to form a good working system.The components refered in this are a microcontroller(atmega328) is used for controlling input and output pins.A motion sensor is used helps in object movement detection and helps in controlling the functioning of electrical appliance based on this.This sensor if detects motion it swiches the appliances on if no motion detected it will gets off.
